# Unlocking Xiaohongshu's Algorithm: Underlying Logic and CES Scoring

Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) has become a dominant force in content-driven e-commerce, and understanding its traffic distribution mechanism is crucial for creators and brands aiming for virality. This article delves into the foundational principles of Xiaohongshu's recommendation system and its pivotal CES (Community Engagement Score) formula, based on the latest insights for 2025.

## 1. The Underlying Logic of Xiaohongshu Recommendation

At its core, Xiaohongshu's recommendation system operates on a sophisticated, multi-layered logic designed to match high-quality content with interested users.

**Note Inclusion and Display:** When a user publishes a note, it first undergoes a rigorous review process. Notes that violate platform guidelines will not be included or displayed publicly, remaining visible only to the creator's followers. Compliant content, however, is formally "included" and proceeds to the next stage: "tag classification."

**Tag Classification and Initial Recommendation:** The platform intelligently categorizes notes by assigning relevant tags based on their content. These tags are then used to initiate recommendations, pushing the note to users whose interests align with these classifications.

**Traffic Pool Mechanism:** Once a note enters the recommendation pool, it embarks on a journey through various "traffic pools." The system initially grants a baseline view count (e.g., 200-500 views). Based on the initial engagement metrics—likes, saves, comments, and shares—the system determines if the note is eligible to advance to larger traffic pools (e.g., 2,000 views, then 10,000 views). Notes with higher initial engagement are propelled into progressively larger pools, significantly increasing their exposure.

**CES Scoring for Progression:** The progression through these traffic pools is heavily influenced by the note's CES (Community Engagement Score), a proprietary metric that evaluates content quality. Notes achieving a higher CES score gain access to larger traffic pools, while those with lower scores may see their recommendations reduced.

## 2. Xiaohongshu's CES Scoring Formula

The CES scoring formula is the quantitative backbone of Xiaohongshu's content evaluation, directly impacting a note's reach and visibility.

**CES Score = Likes x1 + Saves x1 + Comments x4 + Shares x4 + Follows x8**

This formula highlights the platform's emphasis on deep user engagement and creator loyalty:

- **Likes and Saves** contribute to the score, indicating initial interest and content utility.
- **Comments and Shares** carry a significantly higher weight (x4), underscoring the importance of active discussion and content dissemination. These actions signal stronger user interest and community interaction.
- **New Follows** generated directly from a note are weighted the highest (x8), demonstrating the ultimate value of content that converts viewers into loyal followers. This metric signifies the content's ability to attract and retain an audience.

> **Pro Tip:** Actively responding to fan comments is a simple yet powerful way to boost your note's CES score. This interaction not only increases the comment count but also fosters a sense of community, encouraging further engagement and potentially leading to new follows.

By understanding and strategically optimizing for the CES formula, creators can significantly enhance their notes' performance and unlock greater traffic potential on Xiaohongshu.
