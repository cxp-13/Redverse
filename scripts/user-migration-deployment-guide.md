# User Migration Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the deployment of user migration compatibility features for Redverse. The system now includes:

1. **User Adapter**: Compatibility layer that handles user queries during migration period
2. **Redis Mappings**: Test environment user ID to email mappings stored in Redis
3. **Email Notification Fixes**: Updated email notification system to work with migrated users

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are properly set:

```bash
# Clerk Production Environment (active)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# Clerk Test Environment (for reference)
CLERK_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_TEST_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Redis (for user mappings)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://crack-quagga-62180.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AfLkAAIjcDE1YmI..."

# Email service
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
ADMIN_EMAIL=lantianlaoli@gmail.com
```

### 2. Files Added/Modified

#### New Files Added:
- `lib/user-adapter.ts` - Main user compatibility adapter
- `scripts/save-user-mapping.js` - Script to save user mappings to Redis
- `scripts/test-user-adapter.js` - Test script for user adapter
- `scripts/test-email-integration.js` - Email integration test

#### Modified Files:
- `lib/actions.ts` - Updated to use user adapter instead of direct Clerk calls
- `.env` - Environment variables separated for test/prod

### 3. Deployment Process

1. **Deploy the code changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add user migration compatibility layer"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify Redis mappings are active**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-user-adapter.js
   ```

3. **Test email integration**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-email-integration.js
   ```

## üîß How It Works

### User Query Flow

```
1. Application needs user info for email notification
   ‚Üì
2. getUserInfo(userId) called
   ‚Üì
3. Try Clerk Production Environment first
   ‚îú‚îÄ Success ‚Üí Return user info from production
   ‚îî‚îÄ User not found ‚Üí Check Redis mapping
      ‚îú‚îÄ Found in Redis ‚Üí Return email from mapping
      ‚îî‚îÄ Not found ‚Üí Return null
```

### Migration Scenarios

1. **Successfully migrated users**: 
   - Found in production Clerk environment
   - Full user info available (name, email, etc.)

2. **Failed migration users**:
   - Not found in production environment
   - Email retrieved from Redis mapping
   - Limited info available (only email)

3. **New production users**:
   - Found in production Clerk environment
   - Full user info available

## üìä Monitoring

### Redis Health Check

The system includes monitoring functions:

```javascript
import { checkRedisMappingHealth } from './lib/user-adapter';

const health = await checkRedisMappingHealth();
console.log(`Redis mappings: ${health.totalMappings} users`);
```

### User Lookup Logging

The user adapter includes detailed logging:

```
[UserAdapter] Getting user info for ID: user_xxx
[UserAdapter] Found user in production environment: user_xxx
# OR
[UserAdapter] User not found in production, checking Redis mapping: user_xxx
[UserAdapter] Found email mapping in Redis: user_xxx -> email@example.com
```

## ‚è∞ Expiration and Cleanup

### Redis Mapping Expiration

- **Current expiration**: 30 days from when mappings were created
- **Auto-cleanup**: Redis will automatically delete expired keys
- **Extension**: If needed, re-run the mapping script to extend expiration

### Extending Mappings

If the 30-day period needs extension:

```bash
node scripts/save-user-mapping.js
```

This will refresh all mappings with a new 30-day expiration.

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Test migrated user notification**:
   - Create/update a note for a successfully migrated user
   - Verify email is sent to correct address

2. **Test failed migration user notification**:
   - Create/update a note for a user that failed migration
   - Verify email is sent using Redis mapping

3. **Test new production user**:
   - Sign up new user in production
   - Verify all functionality works normally

### Integration Tests

Run the provided test scripts:

```bash
# Test user adapter functionality
node scripts/test-user-adapter.js

# Test email integration
node scripts/test-email-integration.js
```

## üìà Migration Statistics

Current migration status:

- **Total test users**: 21
- **Successfully migrated**: 4 users (19%)
- **Redis mappings created**: 21 users
- **Redis expiration**: 30 days
- **Migration date**: 2025-08-15

Successfully migrated users:
- `aknurseidazym@gmail.com`
- `marvel551478@gmail.com`
- `vivekgautamofficial@gmail.com`
- `corentin.probusiness@gmail.com`

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **User not found error**:
   - Check Redis connection: `node scripts/test-user-adapter.js`
   - Verify user ID exists in mappings
   - Check Redis key expiration

2. **Email not sent**:
   - Check logs for `[UserAdapter]` messages
   - Verify Redis mapping exists
   - Check email service configuration

3. **Redis connection failed**:
   - Verify `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
   - Test connection independently

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check specific user mapping
redis-cli -u $UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL get "test_user_email:user_xxx"

# List all user mappings
redis-cli -u $UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL keys "test_user_email:*"

# Check migration info
redis-cli -u $UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL get "user_migration_info"
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:

- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ Email notifications work for both migrated and non-migrated users
- ‚úÖ Redis mappings are accessible
- ‚úÖ No errors in production logs related to user queries
- ‚úÖ Failed migration users still receive email notifications

## üìû Support

If issues arise:

1. Check the logs for `[UserAdapter]` messages
2. Run the test scripts to diagnose issues
3. Verify environment variables are correct
4. Check Redis connectivity and data

The system is designed to be fault-tolerant - if Redis fails, users will still get notifications, just potentially with less information (fallback email addresses).
