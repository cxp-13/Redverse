# Redverse

A platform connecting global AI innovation with the Chinese market. International developers submit their AI applications, which are then reviewed and published on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), helping them reach hundreds of millions of Chinese users.

Redverse bridges the gap between innovative AI products from around the world and China's vibrant social commerce ecosystem, making it easier for creators to tap into one of the world's largest and most engaged user bases.
